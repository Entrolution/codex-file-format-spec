# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this specification, please report it responsibly.

### For Specification Issues

If you find a security flaw in the specification itself (e.g., a cryptographic weakness, a design flaw that could be exploited), please:

1. **Do not** open a public issue
2. Email [greg.vonnessi@entrolution.ai](mailto:greg.vonnessi@entrolution.ai) with details
3. Allow reasonable time for the issue to be addressed before public disclosure

### For Implementation Issues

If you find a security issue in the reference implementation ([cdx-core](https://github.com/gvonness-apolitical/cdx-core)), please report it in that repository's security advisories.

## Scope

This security policy covers:

- The Codex Document Format specification
- JSON schemas in this repository
- Example documents in this repository

## Security Considerations in the Specification

The specification includes several security-relevant sections:

- **Document Hashing** (spec/core/06-document-hashing.md) - Content integrity
- **State Machine** (spec/core/07-state-machine.md) - Document lifecycle security
- **Security Extension** (spec/extensions/security/) - Signatures and encryption

When implementing the specification, pay particular attention to these sections.
