# Codex Format Use Cases

This document describes concrete scenarios where the Codex format provides value over existing solutions.

## 1. Legal Contracts and Agreements

### Scenario
A law firm drafts contracts that require signatures from multiple parties, must be archived for decades, and need to be searchable for due diligence.

### Current Pain Points
- PDF signatures are complex and often break on viewer updates
- Signed PDFs can't be easily searched or analyzed
- No clear "frozen" state — uncertainty about what was actually signed
- Format conversion loses fidelity

### Codex Solution
```
1. Draft contract in Codex editor (state: draft)
2. Submit for review (state: review) — all parties can comment
3. Final version frozen with signatures (state: frozen)
   - Document ID cryptographically binds content to signatures
   - Any modification attempt detected immediately
4. Archive for long-term storage
   - Semantic structure preserved
   - Full-text search works perfectly
   - AI can extract clauses and obligations
```

### Key Benefits
- **Clear freeze semantics**: Signature = content locked
- **Machine readable**: AI can analyze contract terms
- **Long-term validity**: Algorithm-agile signatures can be migrated

## 2. Academic Publishing

### Scenario
A researcher publishes a paper with figures, citations, and supplementary data. The paper must be citeable, preservable, and machine-readable for literature analysis.

### Current Pain Points
- PDF figures are not accessible
- Citations are just text, not linked data
- Supplementary materials require separate downloads
- Text extraction for meta-analysis is unreliable

### Codex Solution
```
Paper structure:
├── Semantic content with structured headings
├── Figures as embedded assets with alt text
├── Citations linked to bibliography entries (JSON-LD)
├── Supplementary data as embedded files
├── Author ORCID identifiers in metadata
└── DOI minted after freeze
```

### Key Benefits
- **Semantic citations**: Bibliography as structured data, not just text
- **Accessible figures**: Alt text and full resolution available
- **Machine analysis**: Literature review AI can reliably extract claims
- **Self-contained**: No broken links to supplementary materials

## 6. Healthcare Records

### Scenario
A hospital generates patient records that must be:
- Signed by attending physician
- Shared with other providers
- Preserved for legal requirements
- Patient-accessible

### Current Pain Points
- HL7/FHIR for data, PDF for documents — two systems
- Signatures tied to proprietary systems
- Patient portals show images of documents
- Long-term format stability uncertain

### Codex Solution
```
Medical record:
├── Content: clinical notes as semantic blocks
├── Security:
│   ├── Physician signature (ES256)
│   ├── Timestamp from trusted authority
│   └── Encryption for PHI
├── Semantic extension:
│   ├── FHIR resources as JSON-LD
